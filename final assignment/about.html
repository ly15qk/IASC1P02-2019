  <h1 class="whatwedo">What We Do</h1>
  <p class="aboutus">Here at Paws, we are dedicated to providing a better life to all our rescue dogs. As much as we would love to take them all home ourselves it just isn't realistic. This is why our support group, you guys, are so important! Every week our available rescue dogs are updated, so keep checking back for more! We love being able to provide reduced grooming options for all of our adoption parents to say 'thank you'. Without you, we wouldn't be able to help all the pups like we do. For more information about our foundation, don't hesitate to email or call. We are happy to answer any questions you have!<br/></p>
  <h1 class="benefits">Why Having a Dog is Good for You!</h1>
  <p class="benefitstext">Dogs can be more than just pets. Research has shown that they can provide health benefits for their families. Dogs are able to lower levels of stress, not only for kids but also their owners.  It's also been shown that dogs can lower cholesterol, blood pressure and reduce heart attacks for their owners. Some dogs are even able to use their super-smelling senses to sniff out some cancers in humans!  Another benefit is that they can keep you fit and active. Dogs must be walked multiple times a day, so dog owners are likely to hit their recommended exercise goal per week.</p>
